# GraphQL + gRPC

This is a sample project using [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) as an isolate [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) service and using [Mali](https://mali.js.org/) as a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) backend microservices.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:JustinWang23/graphql-grpc-apollo-mali-api.git

cd node-graphql
